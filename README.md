## Deployment Steps

1. Create new Twitter Account for your bot (Note: You should set your bot account as managed by your company or personal account)
2. Get Twitter Developer API keys from https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard (Note: Unfortunately you'll need the basic/paid tier for this bot to work)
3. [Optional] Create an Airtable account and create a personal access token - If you don't want to use airtable you can comment out references to it in the code.
4. [Airtable] If you choose to do logging (the default option) then you'll need to create an airtable table with the columns here.
5. Close this github repo
6. Create railway account to host your code (or host whereever you want)
7. Add your environment variables to a .env file, your railway app, or whereever you host your app
8. Deploy and run!
